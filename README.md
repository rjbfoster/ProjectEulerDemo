# Project Euler Demo

Project Euler Demo is a basic C# console application which will demonstrate how to sovle the first 100 mathematical problems which are available in Project Euler.

Learn about Project Euler here: https://projecteuler.net/

## Purpose

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the programmattic solving of the first 100 problems in Project Euler.

It also demonstrates the following concepts in C#:
* String input and parsing
* Use of dictionary, delegates, and custom classes
* Custom exceptions and error handling
* Use of various C# iterative and mathematical methods

## Usage

TBD

## Roadmap

Although the base application is complete, the first 100 problems are still being completed. The immediate roadmap is to complete the relevant methods, and optimise the application as required.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repo are not being accepted until the first 100 problems are complete.
